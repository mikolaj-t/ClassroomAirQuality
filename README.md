# ClassroomAirQuality
Educational project, an Android app for displaying sensor data about air quality read from arduino. To use in classrooms.

Currently supports only Polish language. At the moment, it lacks code responsible for receiving data from Arduino sensors. However, front-end is built and designed fully independently and is functional, just the data shown is random.

Originally made for E(x)plory 2019 competition.
